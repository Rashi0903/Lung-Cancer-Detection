## 💡 Project Overview

Lung cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, and early detection is key to improving survival rates. This project leverages cutting-edge deep learning models — **GANs for data augmentation**, **EfficientNet for accurate classification**, and **MobileNet for lightweight deployment** — to build a powerful and efficient lung cancer detection system from CT scan images.

## 🧠 Core Components

### 1. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
- Used to generate synthetic lung CT images
- Solves data imbalance issues (especially rare cases like early-stage nodules)
- Boosts generalization performance for downstream models

### 2. **EfficientNet**
- A highly scalable and accurate CNN architecture
- Used for classifying lung cancer stages (Benign, Malignant, etc.)
- Pretrained with ImageNet and fine-tuned on our dataset

### 3. **MobileNet**
- Lightweight, real-time inference model
- Suitable for mobile/embedded healthcare solutions
- Excellent performance with reduced computational cost
