## üß† Core Components

### 1. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
- Used to generate synthetic lung CT images
- Solves data imbalance issues (especially rare cases like early-stage nodules)
- Boosts generalization performance for downstream models

### 2. **EfficientNet**
- A highly scalable and accurate CNN architecture
- Used for classifying lung cancer stages (Benign, Malignant, etc.)
- Pretrained with ImageNet and fine-tuned on our dataset

### 3. **MobileNet**
- Lightweight, real-time inference model
- Suitable for mobile/embedded healthcare solutions
- Excellent performance with reduced computational cost
